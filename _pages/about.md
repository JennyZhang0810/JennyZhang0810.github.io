I'm a first-year graduate student from the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.scse.uestc.edu.cn/), [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/). My research interests include computer vision, image generation, and image processing.

I am a member of the [Center for Future Media](https://cfm.uestc.edu.cn/index) at UESTC and am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yang Yang](https://cfm.uestc.edu.cn/~yangyang/) and [Prof. Wang Guoqing](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=V08v5OEAAAAJ) from the School of Computer Science and Engineering, UESTC.
